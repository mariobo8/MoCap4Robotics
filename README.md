# MoCap4Robotics

## Introduction

MoCap4Robotics is an ongoing project to develop a cost-effective motion capture system using PS3 Eye cameras. This system aims to provide an affordable alternative to expensive commercial solutions like Vicon, specifically tailored for robotics projects.

## Project Goals

- Create a low-cost motion capture system using PS3 Eye cameras
- Develop software for multi-camera synchronization and 3D tracking
- Provide real-time data processing for robotics applications
- Offer an open-source solution that can be customized for various robotics projects
- Make motion capture technology more accessible to researchers, educators, and hobbyists

**Note: This project is currently under active development. Features and capabilities are subject to change.**
